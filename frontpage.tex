\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

The escalating concern over road safety has intensified the need for practical and accurate driver monitoring systems, especially in resource-constrained and privacy-sensitive environments. Conventional drowsiness detection methods rely on physiological signals or vehicle behaviors, often resulting in intrusive setups and limited adaptability to diverse situations.

Computer vision-based frameworks offer a promising alternative by analyzing facial features and behavioral cues to assess driver alertness. By leveraging robust techniques such as Haar cascade classifiers and facial landmark detection, systems extract critical metrics—such as Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)—to intelligently infer fatigue, all while ensuring non-intrusive operation.

Machine learning classifiers further enhance accuracy by modeling complex temporal and individual patterns. Evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in detection sensitivity and user comfort compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the system’s applicability to personal vehicles, commercial fleets, and emerging autonomous platforms.

Overall, this vision-driven paradigm marks a shift from invasive bio-signals toward intelligent, adaptive, and context-aware safety solutions, setting the foundation for next-generation, scalable automotive safety systems.
